# Import your settings

When you create a Feniks Chat account using an email address already associated with
an account in another Feniks Chat organization, on Feniks Chat Cloud or the same self-hosted
Feniks Chat installation, you can import your user settings from an existing account.
It's a convenient way to preserve the user settings that you've already customized.

!!! tip ""

    Settings that may not apply to all organizations, such as custom profile
    fields, will not be imported.

The import will include your:

- [Name and avatar](/#settings/profile)
- [Privacy settings](/#settings/account-and-privacy)
- [Display settings](/#settings/display-settings)
- [Notification settings](/#settings/notifications)
